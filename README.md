HitchHub :

To solve the problems of traveling alone, lack of money for transportation, and dependence
on expensive taxis or public transport, we can create a platform that connects people with 
similar travel routes and needs. This platform lets individuals find companions going to 
the same destination. They can communicate and agree on traveling together and sharing costs. 
This alternative offers a cheap and safer way to hitchhike and make journeys more affordable.

Our objective is to build a platform to connect hitch hikers and travellers together to ease out
the uncertainties involved during hitch hiking.

This is a joint platform that connects hitchhikers and automobile travelers, reducing uncertainty
in their journeys and potentially replacing traditional taxi systems. It allows people to travel 
together at little or no cost, providing companionship and alleviating solitude. This platform aims
to make hitchhiking easier and could become a popular mode of transportation in the future.
